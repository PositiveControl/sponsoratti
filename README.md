## The Story / What is Sponsoratti?
### The Story
In 2011, I was playing on a summer kickball league and noticed that one or two of the teams (of 12 teams) had t-shirts that their company had supplied for the team, the other teams, mine included, wore whatever t-shirt we had on that day.  Then it dawned on me... companies give away free swag all that time and write it off as marketing.  Why not pair summer sports teams with companies willing to do that?  The companies get cheap marketing when their shirts are worn to games and then to the bar after the game for happy hour, and the teams... they get to look good in their free team shirts.  Win-win.

### What is Sponsoratti?

#### Sports Teams, Groups and Individuals
Whether you've influence in numbers, or influence is your number.

Sponsoratti can make you the best looking team on the field by pairing your team with a company looking to promote its brand. They supply your team with company and team branded t-shirts/hats/swag and maybe even a portion of, if not all of, your team league dues. All you have to do is look good wearing your joint team-company branded gear, while you play ball and go out for social gatherings after the game.

#### Businesses and Causes
Walking billboards, for a fraction of the cost!

You could pay thousands of dollars per month for a billboard, or, you could pay a fraction and sponsor a sports team in your chosen locale. Just give us the logo and colors you'd like to be used, we'll create the t-shirts complete with your company's logo and your sponsored team's player info (number, name, team name). Voila! Walking billboards, from city parks to downtown happy hours... your brand is getting known for pennies on the marketing dollar!
